Sadly I have no solid background in CS. There were few CS-related courses in
the University (C++, Optimisation, math and so on), but the major part of my
expertise comes from the experience. My field knowledge is pretty broad, but it
is shallow in some places (in a lot of places) and has big holes here and there.
That is why I really hope Open Source Society University initiative will help
me build vast and complete CS "base".

What is Open Source Society University?
=======================================

`Open Source Society University`_:

    This is a solid path for those of you who want to complete a Computer
    Science course on your own time, for free, with courses from the best
    universities in the World.
    
    In our curriculum, we gave preference to MOOC (Massive Open Online Course)
    style courses because those courses were created with our style of
    learning in mind.

So we have some kind of well known JavaScript Path, but in the broad field
of Computer Science. There is a long list of MOOCs, one also should build
projects after each course.

My Plans
========

I consider January as a good start point for OSS University path. So, let's do
it. I'll track my progress and post status here. The first course is basic -
`Introduction to Computer Science`_ by edX, nevertheless I does not plan to
skip it. With me patience = )
