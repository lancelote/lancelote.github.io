From time to time I check out my *ToRead* folder (believe me it is infinite),
and guess what I found there a week ago - BEST DJANGO TUTORIAL I EVER READ!
Just go ahead and look at this beauty: [Taskbuster Django Tutorial by Marina Mele](http://www.marinamele.com/taskbuster-django-tutorial).
Table of content is available inside the *Read more...*. So why am I so excited
about it? Because [Marina](https://twitter.com/Marina_Mele) used a rare way to
approach tutorial creation. She did not start with *no one used in real world*
practises like many authors do, but goes straight to the best Django
development patterns. She even wrote about environment variables!

## Table of Content

- [Part I – Working environment and start a Django Project][2]
- [Part II – Settings files and Version control][3]
- [Part III – Create a Home Page with TDD, Staticfiles and Templates settings][4]
- [Part IV – Template Inheritance, Website files and Testing with coverage][5]
- [Part V – Internationalization and Localization. Languages and Time zones][6]
- [Part VI – Documenting the TaskBuster Django Boilerplate][7]
- [Part VII.a – Install and Configure PostgreSQL][8]
- [Part VII.b – Install and Configure MySQL][9]
- [Part VIII – User Authentication with a Google Account using Django Allauth][10]
- [Part VIII.b – User Authentication with Twitter using Django Allauth][11]
- [Part IX – Model creation, OneToOne relations, signals, Django Admin][12]
- [Part X – Model creation, ForeignKey relations, testing, Django Admin][13]

## Especially Interesting Topics

Just few topics I want to especially mention:

- [Environment variable][2]
- [Multiple settings files][3]
- [PostgreSQL][8] and [MySQL][9]
- Social AUTH with [Google][10] and [Twitter][11]
- TDD
- [Internationalization and Localization][6]

## To be continued...

So the tutorial is not finished yet. And maybe it will not be finished,
but it is already an excellent source of knowledge for any Junior (Middle?)
Django developer and I really encourage you to check it out if you interesting
in the Wev Development, Python and Django of course.

## Should I start my Django/Python way there?

No, perhaps no. [DjangoGirls tutorial][15] is more suitable for complete
beginners. Taskbuster is a good next step, when you already know some basics.

## I know a better tutorial

Please go ahead and share it in the comments section below!

# Grammar

I want to switch the blog language from Russian to English and this article
will be the first English one here. Though I'm not an English native speaker
so I bet there're a lot (A LOT) of errors/typos and so on. I beg your pardon!
I do my best to improve my English knowledge and practise makes perfect. I
would definitely appreciate any corrections and suggestions!
