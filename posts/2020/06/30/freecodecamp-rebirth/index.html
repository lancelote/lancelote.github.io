<p>In <a class="reference external" href="../../../../2016/02/18/freecodecamp-start/">2016</a> I made an attempt to go through <a class="reference external" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/">Freecodecamp</a> curriculum.
Unfortunately, it was not a very successful attempt as I stopped right after
the <a class="reference external" href="https://codepen.io/lancelote/pen/OMqbMx">first project</a>. I guess the problem was a lack of motivation to learn Web
Development in the first place. Long story short I am now doing a second
attempt and it is much more successful so far.</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->
<div class="section" id="motivation">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Let's clarify my motivation first and how it has changed. In 2016 my motivation
was based solely on theoretic interest as I never really considered switching
to front end Web Development. Which was not a very good ground for
such an ambition endeavour as you my imagine - Freecodecamp has a huge
curriculum and I had a lot of urgent tasks in the ToDo list.</p>
<p>I don't plan to switch to front end in 2020 as well, and I still consider
learning Web Development more like fun and an auxiliary to my Python knowledge.
The major difference is I am going through the curriculum with my sister
(<a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/pavoninushka">Galya</a>) who is learning Frontend with a prosaic practical goal of switching
the career. This is a more serious goal than playing with a new programming
language or a technology so she is much likely to stick with it. I am, on the
other hand, much more motivated to finish the learning path to help her.</p>
<p>I found learning together very inspiring and motivational, you are much less
likely to drop as there is a somewhat "public" commitment. It is hard to
always be enthusiastic which is fine and multiple people compensate each other
"low" points nicely. It also helps to return back to learning after a day or
two of "taking a break" as you know someone is waiting for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="current-status">
<h2>Current Status</h2>
<p>We have finished "Responsive Web Design Certification" and did all five
projects. You can find them in <a class="reference external" href="https://codepen.io/lancelote">my profile</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://codepen.io/pavoninushka">Galya's profile</a> at
<a class="reference external" href="https://codepen.io/">codepen.io</a>.</p>
<p>It was not as easy as I initially expected (HTML and CSS huh?), we struggled
a bit with layouts and flex especially. Nevertheless we tried to push forward
every day at least a bit.</p>
<p>We also posted our projects for review on <a class="reference external" href="https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409">Freecodecamp forum</a>, which was
quite thrilling experience as we both are quite newbies so the projects were
not especially polished and sophisticated. Anyway the feedback from the
community was great and I learned quite a lot from it. Will definitely
recommend you doing the same. If you think your work is not as good to show
to people - overstep your emotions and post it anyway. Do not forget to thank
me later ;)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="future-plans">
<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<p>We are now going through "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures"
certification and there is quite a lot to study and code there. Freecodecamp
measures each Certification as required 300 hours to complete. There will also
be five another projects in the end of the certification - I will publish a
status on completion.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="resume">
<h2>Resume</h2>
<p>If you are interesting in web development I highly recommend going through
Freecodecamp curriculum as it is very good and newcomer-friendly. Keep in
mind it is not an easy task so don't give up on the first problem -
google additional materials, watch relevant guides on YouTube and ask for help
on the forums. I would also recommend finding a studying group as at least in
my experience you are much likely to achieve the goal with a good team
alongside.</p>
