In `2016`_, I attempted to go through the `Freecodecamp`_ curriculum. Unfortunately, it was not a very successful attempt as I stopped right after the `first project`_. I guess the problem was a lack of motivation to learn Web Development in the first place. Long story short, I am now making a second attempt, and it is much more successful so far.

.. TEASER_END

Motivation
==========

Let's clarify my motivation first and how it has changed. In 2016 I based my motivation on theoretic interest as I never considered switching to front end Web Development. It was a weak ground for such an ambitious endeavor. Freecodecamp has a broad curriculum, and I had a lot of urgent tasks in the ToDo list.

I don't plan to switch to the front end in 2020 as well, and I still consider learning Web Development more like fun and an auxiliary to my Python knowledge. The primary difference is I am going through the curriculum with my sister (`Galya`_), who is learning Frontend with a practical goal of switching the career. It is a more serious intent than playing with a new programming language or a technology. She is much likely to stick with it than I was. In the meantime, I am much more motivated to finish the learning path to help her.

I found learning together very inspiring and motivational. You are much less likely to drop as there is a somewhat "public" commitment. It is hard always to be enthusiastic, and it is okay. A team compensates for each other temporal low points. It also helps to return to learning after a day or two of "taking a break" as you know someone is waiting for you.

Current Status
==============

We have finished "Responsive Web Design Certification" and did all five projects. You can find them in `my profile`_ and `Galya's profile`_ at `codepen.io`_.

It was not as easy as I expected (HTML and CSS, huh?), we struggled a bit with layouts and "flex" primarily. Still, we tried to push forward every day at least a bit.

We also posted our projects for review on the `Freecodecamp forum`_. It was quite a thrilling experience as we both are quite newbies, so the projects were not exceptionally polished and sophisticated. Anyway, the feedback from the community was excellent, and I learned quite a lot from it. I recommend you do the same. If you think your work is not as good to show to people - overstep your emotions and post it anyway. Do not forget to thank me later ;)

Future Plans
============

We are now going through the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" certification, and there is quite a lot to study and code there. Freecodecamp measures each Certification as required 300 hours to complete. There will also be five other projects at the end of the Certification - I will publish a status on completion.

Resume
======

If you are interested in web development, I recommend going through the Freecodecamp curriculum as it is an excellent and newcomer-friendly resource. It is not an easy task, so don't give up on the first problem - google extra materials, watch relevant guides on YouTube, and ask for help on the forums. I would also recommend finding a studying group as, at least in my experience, you are much likely to achieve the goal with a supportive team alongside.
