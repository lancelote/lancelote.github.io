In `2016`_ I made an attempt to go through `Freecodecamp`_ curriculum.
Unfortunately, I it was not a very successful attempt as I stopped right after
the first project. I guess the problem was a lack of motivation to learn Web
development in the first place. Long story short I am now doing a second
attempt and it is much more successful so far.
