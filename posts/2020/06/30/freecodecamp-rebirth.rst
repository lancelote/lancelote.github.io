In `2016`_ I made an attempt to go through `Freecodecamp`_ curriculum.
Unfortunately, it was not a very successful attempt as I stopped right after
the `first project`_. I guess the problem was a lack of motivation to learn Web
Development in the first place. Long story short I am now doing a second
attempt and it is much more successful so far.

Motivation
==========

Let's clarify my motivation first and how it has changed. In 2016 my motivation
was based solely on theoretic interest as I never really considered switching
to front end Web Development full time. Which was not a very good ground for
such an ambition endeavour as you my imagine - Freecodecamp has a huge
curriculum and I had a lot of more urgent tasks in the ToDo list.

I don't plan to switch to front end in 2020 as well, and I still consider
learning Web Development more like an auxiliary to my Python knowledge and
fun. The major difference is I am going through the curriculum with my sister
(`Galya`_) who is learning front end with a prosaic practical goal of switching
the career. This is a more serious goal than playing with new programming
language and technology so she is much likely to stick with it. I on the other
hand is much more motivated to help her.

I found learning together very inspiring and motivational, you are much less
likely to drop as there is a somewhat "public" commitment. It is hard to
always be enthusiastic which is fine and multiple people compensate each other
"low" points nicely. It also helps to return back to learning after day or two
of "relaxing" as you know someone is waiting for you.

Current Status
==============

We have finished "Responsive Web Design Certification" and did all five
projects. You can find them in `my profile`_ and `Galya's profile`_ at
`codepen.io`_.

It was not as easy as I expected, we struggled a bit with layouts and flex,
but we tried to push forward every day.

We also posted our projects for review on `Freecodecamp forum`_, which was
quite thrilling as we both quite newbies so the projects were not especially
polished and sophisticated. Anyway the feedback from the community was great
and I learned quite a lot from it. Will definitely recommend you doing the
same. If you think your work is not as good to show to people - overstep your
emotions and post it, thank me later ;)
