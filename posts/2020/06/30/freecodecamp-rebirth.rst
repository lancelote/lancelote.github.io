In `2016`_ I made an attempt to go through `Freecodecamp`_ curriculum.
Unfortunately, it was not a very successful attempt as I stopped right after
the `first project`_. I guess the problem was a lack of motivation to learn Web
Development in the first place. Long story short I am now doing a second
attempt and it is much more successful so far.

Motivation
==========

Let's clarify my motivation first and how it has changed. In 2016 my motivation
was based solely on theoretic interest as I never really considered switching
to front end Web Development full time. Which was not a very good ground for
such an ambition endeavour as you my imagine - Freecodecamp has a huge
curriculum and I had a lot of more urgent tasks in the ToDo list.

I don't plan to switch to front end in 2020 as well, and I still consider
learning Web Development more like an auxiliary to my Python knowledge and
fun. The major difference is I am going through the curriculum with my sister
who is learning front end with a prosaic practical goal of switching the
career. This is a more serious goal than playing with new programming language
and technology so she is much likely to stick with it. I on the other hand is
much more motivated to help her.

ToDo: wrote about the importance of a group learning for a motivation
