I had a great chance to visit Hyperskill_ presentation last month, which is a
new MOOC (?) provider for Java and Kotlin (at the moment of writing). Few days
ago I also finished the first Java project there and want to quickly write my
impression.

.. TEASER_END

About
=====

There are a lot of websites these days to learn coding. Hyperskill focus, as
I understand it, is learning via projects. The platform has a number of them
and supports Java and Kotlin. Your code is tested on the server and there is a
great integration with Intellij IDEA through EDU plugin if you prefer to write
code assignments locally.

Projects
========

At the moment of writing there are 32 projects_ for Java, which is a quite
surprising amount taking into account Hyperskill young age and the project
sizes.

Projects are vary in complexity and in topics from CLI for Coffee Machine,
Tic-Tac-Toe AI and Calculator to Digit Image Recognition, Game of Life
Simulation and Text Editor (!).

Apart from the project implementation steps there are some reading theory parts
which cover various Java-related topics, quizzes and small coding assignments
to check your understanding. I especially like the amount of extra exercises on
each topic - you can skip most of it in case you got the first N right, but
there are plenty additional tasks so you can learn the new material by heart.

Map
===

Another unique feature I love is a `Knowledge Map`_ which is basically a net of
topics with cross-references. It is very useful for tracking your progress in
the theory, one can also fast-jump to specific subject. The map is interactive
so feel free to play with it yourself.

My Experience
=============

I finished the first project in Java path - building a Coffee Machine CLI.
The project is split in 6 stages each one with more theory and more advanced
implementation task. You can find my code (project and homework) on GitHub_.

My final solution_ takes around 250 lines. Wonder how shorter is it going to be
when rewritten in Kotlin = )

Price
=====

Pretty much everything is free. You can subscribe to a Pro account which allows
one to send project step implementations on review. You can also contribute
new problems to the platform in exchange for a Pro account.

Verdict
=======

Highly recommended. The focus on projects is quite unique, or at least I never
saw the same approach. Knowledge map allows you to track the path, everything
runs smoothly and there are not many people at the moment ;)
